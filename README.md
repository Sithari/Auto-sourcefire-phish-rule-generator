# automated-IDS-rule-Generation-for-Phishing-Sites
Given a set of phishing links, this script will generate sourcefire rules to detect successfully phished victims on your network.
Currently the script has two options:

1. Download the csv file with thousands of live phishing sites from phishtank.com
2. Constantly refresh and download new sites from phishtank.com (beta).
